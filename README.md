web-dumper
==========

If you are unsatisfied with **wget** about recursive downloading websites you will find **web-dumper** a great idea.

When you are browsing with a navigator it downloads the entire page regardless if the domain is the same, when you use **wget** you have to set if it will allow or deny spanning across hosts, this rule will remain the entire schedule.

So **web-dumper** prevents this inconvenience, when it interprets a page it will download all related files regardless of which source, the rules about domain only will be applied on the next page to be interpreted.
